# My Personal Website

I made this website in my Sophmore year of college and as of now I am still in the process of working on it. You can visit the site at the custom domain www.natekoe.com.

## About Me

## About The Website

I made this website public to hopefully give people a better understanding of what I did to make it and also as a way to allow people to suggest edits and changes, or just steal bits and pieces of it as they choose. I believe that the internet is a beautiful thing, and that the bricks that comprise it should all be polished and shined to pristine quality. I would like to exemplify my own belief and help others to beautify their webpages too. If you have any criticisms, please feel free to contact me!
