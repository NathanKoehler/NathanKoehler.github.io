# My Website

I made this website in my Sophomore year of college. Even today, I am in the process of further improving it. You can visit the site at the custom domain www.natekoe.com.

## About Me

I am a Junior Student studying Interaction Design and Media within the Computational Media Major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I plan on doing design or programming out of college.

## About The Website

I made this website public to hopefully give people a better understanding of what I did to make it and as a way to allow people to suggest edits and additions to the page. I also encourage others to steal bits and pieces of it as they choose. 

I believe that the internet is a beautiful thing and that the bricks that comprise it should all be polished and shined to pristine quality. 

I aim to exemplify my own belief and help others to beautify their web pages too. 

If you have any criticisms, please feel free to contact me!
